## <span id = "game-overview">2. Game Overview</span>

This game called NewDots is inspired by [Dots: A Game About Connecting](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nerdyoctopus.gamedots). 
It is quite easy to play. The players connect the dots with same colour vertically or horizontally to win the score. 
Connect the dots making a [square](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5976992/RetroGame2018s1/blob/master/ideas/demo/9_step_mode_connecting_square.jpg) will eliminate all dots with the same colour and earn more score.
There are [four modes](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5976992/RetroGame2018s1/blob/master/ideas/demo/1_start_page.png) for players to choose. 
[LEVEL MODE](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5976992/RetroGame2018s1/blob/master/ideas/demo/3_level_mode.jpg) increases the difficulty each level. 
In [TIME MODE](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5976992/RetroGame2018s1/blob/master/ideas/demo/4_time_mode.jpg), players must take quick reactions to get more score. 
And in [STEP MODE](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5976992/RetroGame2018s1/blob/master/ideas/demo/5_step_mode.jpg), players can get better results with strategies.
